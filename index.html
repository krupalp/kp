      About me
    </title>
    <p1>
      I am currently a rising senior at The University of Georgie double majoring in Computer Science and Economics.
      The combination of these two degrees is the result of my interests in blending Economics and Computer Science to bridge the gap between technology and business. 
      By exploring these two separate streams, I hope to reach a point where ideas and concepts flow together to form a river.
